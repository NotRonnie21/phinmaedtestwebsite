                        <p>The PHINMA story began in 1956 and it's a kind of story that will be told and retold as a fitting tribute to the enterprising men who had high hopes for the Filipino and the national economy. Their names belong to an honor list of Who's Who in Philippine business—Filamon C. Rodriguez, Ramon V. del Rosario, Sr. and Ernesto O. Escoler.</p>
                        <p>These pioneers were accomplished professionals in their respective fields. They were young and ambitious. But they were different. They were visionaries and they set themselves apart by thinking big for the country and its people. They believed in developing Filipino entrepreneurship, in promoting the professional management skills of Filipino managers, in corporate social responsibility and community building.</p>
                        <p>With the establishment of PHINMA came the birth of a business organization that would give rise to a culture of excellence—one that would touch the lives of millions of Filipinos and contribute to the development of Filipino enterprise, as well as the upliftment of the average person's quality of life.</p>

We will aggressively seek opportunities primarily in the services sector that will allow us to address the basic needs of our society, while being globally competitive and generating attractive stakeholder values.</p>
            
            
                        <p>In pursuit of our Mission, we look to our tradition, our experience, our reputation and, above all, our people, as the principal factors that will enable us to achieve our lofty goals.</p>
            
            
                        <p>We believe that a well-qualified and competitively compensated work force, treated with trust and respect, will be a highly motivated and productive partner in the pursuit of our goals. We shall continue to conduct ourselves according to the highest ideals of competence, patriotism, integrity and professionalism. The PHINMA Group believes that the process of self-improvement and innovation, and the quest for excellence, are never-ending tasks.</p>

                        <p>Changes in the Philippine business climate and the global economy have led the PHINMA Group to embark on a new direction. From a conglomerate involved in heavy industry and manufacturing, particularly in cement and paper, the company now believes that it will best serve the nation's and its stockholders' interest by focusing on the Filipinos' basic needs.</p>
            
            
                        <p>With effective management as its principal resource, the company believes it can contribute high-quality but affordable education, decent and affordable homes, reliable and affordable electricity, and other goods and services that touch people's lives daily.</p>
            
            
                        <p>Today, the PHINMA Group is pursuing opportunities in energy, low-cost housing, education, and financial services, and is considering investments in service-oriented businesses. To illustrate, the company laid the foundation of its education business in 2004 with the acquisition of the 7,000-student Araullo University in Cabanatuan City. Its low-cost housing subsidiary, PHINMA Property Holdings, has become the largest developer of low-cost, medium-rise condominiums. Its affiliate TA Oil & Energy has constructed a power plant that will supply the energy requirements of Guimaras province in the Visayas.</p>
            
            
                        <p>These companies make up a huge reservoir of potential contribution that the country would require to sustain its growth program. With its capabilities in energy development, power generation, education, low-cost housing, financial and management services, the PHINMA Group is well on its way to becoming a major player in the country's thrust toward social upliftment and economic progress—a familiar role envisioned by its founders since its establishment in 1956.</p>
